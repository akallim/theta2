Description: Calculates the theta and zeta indices as means to quantify the phylogenetic signal of categorical traits. This approach uses the phylogenetic tree as classification tree and quantifies the extent of pruning that can be applied to the tree without losing is classification accuracy for the trait of interest. Additionally, it compares observed values with random expectations using a null model of randomizing the species position (and their traits) in the tree.
